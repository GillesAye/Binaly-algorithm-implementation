**Description:**

This Python code implements the binary search algorithm to efficiently find the index of a target value x within a sorted array array.

**How It Works:**

*Initialization:*

low: Index of the first element in the array.

high: Index of the last element in the array.

mid: Index of the middle element, calculated as the average of low and high.

*Iterative Search:*

While low is less than or equal to high:

Calculate the mid index.

If array[mid] is equal to x, return mid (target found).

If array[mid] is less than x, the target must be in the right half of the array, so adjust low to mid + 1.

If array[mid] is greater than x, the target must be in the left half of the array, so adjust high to mid - 1.

*Return Result:*

If the target is not found after the loop, the function returns -1 to indicate that the target is not present in the array.

*Time Complexity:*

Best Case: O(1) (when the target is found in the first comparison)

Average Case: O(log n)

Worst Case: O(log n) (when the target is not found or is at the end of the array)

Space Complexity: O(1) (constant extra space for variables)

*Usage:*

Prepare the array: Ensure the array is sorted in ascending order.

Call the function: Pass the sorted array and the target value x to the binary_tester function.

*Interpret the result:*

If the returned index is non-negative, it indicates the position of the target in the array.
If the returned index is -1, the target is not present in the array.
